# pi-permission-system

Pi extension that enforces deterministic permission gates over tool, bash, MCP, skill, and special operations so the agent cannot silently exceed the policy a user has configured.

This package is a full fork of [`MasuRii/pi-permission-system`](https://github.com/MasuRii/pi-permission-system).
It began as a config-layout divergence (#10) and has since diverged substantially in config format, internal architecture, and permission model.
The `/permission-system` slash command name is the only upstream identity preserved.

Read `docs/plans/` before making architectural changes.
Pre-monorepo plans from the upstream fork live in `docs/plans/archive/` — issue numbers there refer to the upstream repo, not this monorepo.

`docs/architecture/architecture.md` tracks the improvement phases as a flat numbered step list plus a Mermaid graph — one issue per step, never a chain inside a single node label.
When a plan touches that roadmap, enumerate the whole phase: search dependents too (`gh issue list --search "#N"`), not just the issues the current one references.
When the implementation completes a numbered roadmap step, mark it complete in `docs/architecture/architecture.md` in the implementation doc-update commit (`/tdd-plan` step 7 / `/build-plan`), not a deferred `/ship-issue` commit — `✅` on both the step heading and its Mermaid diagram node, plus any stale health-metric/target rows in the same commit.
Deferring the marker to ship splits it from the work and risks it falling through entirely (Refs #479, #480).
A dated `Baseline (<date>)` column is a fixed phase-open snapshot recomputed at phase close, not a per-step value — do not edit it as work lands (Refs #573).

## Implementation Priorities

- Default to least privilege — when in doubt, prompt (`ask`), do not silently allow.
- Enforce permissions deterministically; the same policy + same input must always produce the same decision.
- Keep config files the source of truth; do not bake policy into code.
- Hide denied tools from the agent before it starts (tool filtering + system-prompt sanitization).
- Keep block/ask/allow decisions reviewable: write to the permission review log by default.
- Preserve the `/permission-system` slash command name — renaming it is a breaking change.
- In the flat permission format, `permission["*"]` is the universal fallback; pattern ordering is last-match-wins.
- The four path layers (`path`, `external_directory`, per-tool, `bash`) compose with **most-restrictive-wins** across surfaces: a more-permissive rule on one surface cannot loosen a more-restrictive rule on another (`ask` > `allow`).
  So a `path` allow cannot suppress an `external_directory: ask` prompt — allow outside-CWD directories on `external_directory`, not `path`.
- Wildcard matching must be explicit and tested — silent over-matching is a permission bypass.
- Prefer config patterns over new runtime mechanisms.
  Mechanism is forever; docs are reversible.
- Treat any declared config field not read at runtime as a maintenance trap.

### Single source of truth for tool policy

Pi-subagents removed its `disallowed_tools` frontmatter field and `extensions: string[]` allowlist (pi-subagents Phase 14, #237, #238, #239 — shipped).
This package is the **sole authority** for tool access control.
Users migrating from `disallowed_tools` should use `permission:` frontmatter in agent definitions:

```yaml
# Before (pi-subagents, removed in Phase 14)
disallowed_tools: bash

# After (pi-permission-system)
permission:
  bash: deny
```

### Event-based subagent integration

`@gotgenes/pi-subagents` emits a child-execution lifecycle on `pi.events` (`subagents:child:*`); this package subscribes via `subscribeSubagentLifecycle` (`src/authority/subagent-lifecycle-events.ts`) and registers/unregisters child sessions in the `SubagentSessionRegistry` on `session-created` / `disposed` (pi-subagents [#261], [ADR-0002]).
The dependency direction is inverted — pi-subagents has zero knowledge of pi-permission-system.
The `session-created` handler MUST stay synchronous: the core emits it on the same call stack right before `bindExtensions()`, and the event bus dispatches listeners synchronously, so a synchronous handler lands the registry entry before binding proceeds.

**The `SubagentSessionRegistry` is process-global.**
Access it via `getSubagentSessionRegistry()` (`src/authority/subagent-registry.ts`), backed by `globalThis` + `Symbol.for("@gotgenes/pi-permission-system:subagent-registry")`.
This is necessary because each session's `ResourceLoader` creates its own `pi.events` bus: the parent emits `subagents:child:session-created` on its bus and only the parent's instance receives it.
The child's separate jiti instance runs on a different bus and never receives the event — but `getSubagentSessionRegistry()` returns the same global store, so the parent's registration is visible to the child when it checks `isSubagentExecutionContext()`.
Do not instantiate `new SubagentSessionRegistry()` in production code; use the accessor.
This lesson comes from issue [#296]: the regression where `permission-bridge.ts` was retired in favour of `pi.events` registration but the per-session bus split meant the child never saw the registration.

## Configuration

One unified config file per scope, following the `pi-autoformat` convention (`extensions/<id>/config.json`).

- **Global config**: `~/.pi/agent/extensions/pi-permission-system/config.json` (respects `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`)
- **Project config**: `<cwd>/.pi/extensions/pi-permission-system/config.json`
- **Per-agent overrides**: YAML frontmatter in agent definition files

Merge precedence: project overrides global; per-agent frontmatter overrides both.
The `permission` object uses deep-shallow merge; scalar fields use simple replacement.

- Zod source of truth: `src/config-schema.ts` (the composable schemas, the `z.infer` config types, and `buildPermissionsJsonSchema`).
- Schema: `schemas/permissions.schema.json` — **generated** from `config-schema.ts` via `pnpm run gen:schema`; never edit it by hand.
  A parity test in `test/config-schema.test.ts` fails on drift (Refs #547).
- Example: `config/config.example.json`
- Keep `config-schema.ts`, example config, `docs/configuration.md`, and `README.md` aligned when the config shape changes — the schema and the config types are both derived from `config-schema.ts`, so it is the one edit point.
- `docs/architecture/architecture.md` inline-copies the core `rule.ts` types (`Rule`, `RuleOrigin`, `Ruleset`).
  Adding or removing a field on one of these must update that listing too — a module-move check misses it, and only the pre-completion reviewer catches it otherwise.
- Config **files** are validated strictly against `unifiedConfigSchema` (`config-schema.ts`) and rejected **fail-closed** on any invalid field (empty scope → universal `ask`), with a clear per-issue message (Refs #547).
  A rejected **non-global** scope (project / agent / project-agent) additionally floors the composed policy `allow`→`ask` (origin `fail-closed`) at composition, so a lower scope's `allow` cannot be silently inherited behind an invalid higher scope; `deny` is preserved, global is excluded, and `yoloMode` re-permits the floored `ask` (Refs #646).
  The loader marks such a scope `ScopeConfig.invalid` (a present-but-unloadable file; an absent file stays a plain empty scope); the manager reads the flags in `resolvePermissions` and appends a fail-closed notice to `getConfigIssues`.
  Per-agent frontmatter stays tolerant — `policy-loader.ts` extracts only its `permission` block via `normalizeFlatPermissionValue`, since frontmatter carries non-config keys; only a whole-file read/parse failure of an existing agent file marks the scope invalid, not a tolerantly-dropped per-key entry.
- When removing a config field, drop it from `unifiedConfigSchema`; configs that still set it are then rejected.
  For a soft-deprecation window, keep the field optional in the schema and ignore its value.
- When adding an optional field to `PermissionSystemExtensionConfig`, do not include it in `DEFAULT_EXTENSION_CONFIG` with an explicit `undefined` value — tests use `deepEqual` and it breaks equality.
- When adding a field, define it in `unifiedConfigSchema` (`config-schema.ts`, with `.meta({ description, markdownDescription })`) and regenerate the schema (`pnpm run gen:schema`); `UnifiedPermissionConfig` is inferred from it.
  Then carry it through `PermissionSystemExtensionConfig` (`extension-config.ts`) and merge it in `mergeUnifiedConfigs()`.
  A field on the runtime type but not the merge intermediate is silently dropped before runtime (the #332 / #347 bug class).
  After #356, omitting a field from `UnifiedPermissionConfig` that `normalizePermissionSystemConfig` reads is a **compile error** — `normalizePermissionSystemConfig` reads fields directly from the typed `UnifiedPermissionConfig` parameter, so `tsc` catches the gap immediately.
- When a config example sets a policy for `write`, include the same policy for `edit` — both tools modify files and users expect them gated together.

## Log writes

Both JSONL logs are created owner-only (`0600`, in a `0700` directory) and key-name redacted; the permission-forwarding request/response files are mode-restricted too (but **not** redacted — the parent reads them to render the ask-prompt).
Do not add a log write path that bypasses `writeLine` in `src/logging.ts`, and do not pass a `mode`-less `appendFileSync`/`writeFileSync`/`mkdirSync` for an artifact holding tool input.
Redaction is **structural, never value-shape**: `isSensitiveLogKey` (`src/log-redaction.ts`) masks a value because of the key name it is bound to, and a provider-prefix/entropy list was measured against a real 6.7 MB log and declined (403 `sk-` hits, all false positives from `task-*`; zero true positives).
The boundary to repeat verbatim in any doc or reply: a value bound to a sensitive key name is masked; a secret embedded in a bash command string is not.
Redaction is applied at **two** points, and the second is not redundant — `getToolInputPreviewForLog` flattens tool input to a string before the writer sees it, so `serializeRedactedToolInputPreview` (`src/tool-input-preview.ts`) is the only place its keys still exist.
Never redact `formatToolInputForPrompt`: the user must see the real input to decide.
Governing record: `docs/decisions/0010-permission-log-secret-exposure.md` (Refs #647).

## Cross-Extension Integration

### Single-agent core

Pi is single-agent by design; multiple named agents are an external-extension concept (pi-subagents, pi-agent-router), not Pi core.
Per-agent `permission:` frontmatter is an extension bridge on this single-agent core — see `docs/architecture/architecture.md` design principle 9.
Do not propose pushing agent-awareness (an agents directory, frontmatter parsing) into the SDK or core.

### Jiti isolation

Pi's extension loader keeps each extension's module isolated — a variable set in this extension's module is invisible to other extensions.

**Module-scoped state no longer resets per session.**
Since [earendil-works/pi#5905] (shipped in pi-coding-agent — "cache extension imports for session switches"), the loader caches the imported factory function per `(extensionPath, cwd)`.
The factory is still **re-invoked** on every `/new` / `/resume` / `/fork` / `/import` switch (with a fresh `pi`/`ExtensionContext`), so everything constructed *inside* the factory body — `PermissionSession`, `SessionRules`, subscriptions, `pi.on(...)` registrations — is rebuilt fresh each session, and `session_shutdown` still fires.
But the module itself is imported only once per cwd; the cache clears only on `/reload` or a cwd change (`clearExtensionCache`).
So module-scoped mutable state (top-level `let`, module-level caches, memoized values like `getParser = memoizeAsyncWithRetry(...)` in `access-intent/bash/parser.ts`) now persists across same-cwd session switches instead of being reborn each session.
This is safe today (the package's module-scoped state is read-only lookup tables plus the stateless tree-sitter parser — persisting the parser is a win), but **do not park session-scoped or permission-relevant state at module level assuming a per-session reset** — it will leak between sessions in the same cwd.
Keep per-session state inside the factory closure (where it is rebuilt) or in the `session_start`/`session_shutdown`-driven lifecycle.
A regression guard lives in `test/composition-root.test.ts` ("session approvals do not leak across same-cwd session switches").

Shared communication channels:

- **`pi.events`** (the event bus) — for fire-and-forget broadcasts (`permissions:ready` / `permissions:ui_prompt` / `permissions:decision`).
- **`globalThis` + `Symbol.for()`** — process-global by spec, survives jiti isolation.
  Use for direct service access.

The deprecated event-bus RPC channel (`permissions:rpc:check` / `permissions:rpc:prompt`) was removed in #531; the `Symbol.for()` service accessor is the sole cross-extension policy/prompt surface.
The in-process implementation of `PermissionsService` is `LocalPermissionsService` (`src/permissions-service.ts`).
It routes policy queries through the `PermissionResolver`, not `PermissionManager` directly: a path-shaped surface (`path` / `external_directory` / `read` / `write` / `edit` / `grep` / `find` / `ls`) query builds an `AccessPath` via `buildAccessIntentForSurface` and emits an `access-path` intent, so external queries match the lexical ∪ canonical set the gates do (#503); the normalizer is fetched per call from the session (`getPathNormalizer()`), so the published service answers against the parent cwd.
A `bash` query routes through `resolveBashAdvisoryCheck` (`src/bash-advisory-check.ts`), which decomposes a chained/nested command into its command-pattern units and resolves most-restrictive at parity with the gate (via the shared `resolveBashCommandCheck`), backed by a parser warmed at `before_agent_start`; in the pre-warm window it falls back to a whole-string match, so the advisory answer is never weaker than the gate (#309).
The `session_start`-gated publication, #302 subagent-child guard, ready-event emit, and session teardown ordering are all owned by `PermissionServiceLifecycle` (`src/service-lifecycle.ts`), which is injected into `SessionLifecycleHandler`.
Changes to publication timing or teardown order should go through `PermissionServiceLifecycle`, not `index.ts`.

Do not propose module-scoped singletons or Node.js module-cache sharing as a cross-extension communication mechanism — module isolation keeps them invisible to other extensions.

[earendil-works/pi#5905]: https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/5905

The `path` and `external_directory` gates are path-aware for **all** tools, not just the six built-ins (#352).
`getToolInputPath` (`src/access-intent/tool-input-path.ts`) extracts a path for built-ins (`input.path`), MCP (`input.arguments.path`), and extension tools (default `input.path`, or a custom key via a registered extractor); `getPathBearingToolPath` stays built-in-only and now drives the per-tool gate's `AccessPath` (the pipeline builds `normalizer.forPath(getPathBearingToolPath(...))` and emits an `access-path` intent on the tool-name surface, #502), plus the raw decision/log value.
The `ToolAccessExtractorRegistry` (`src/tool-access-extractor-registry.ts`) mirrors `ToolInputFormatterRegistry`: one instance created in `index.ts`, its lookup threaded into `ToolCallGatePipeline`, its registrar exposed cross-extension via `PermissionsService.registerToolAccessExtractor`.
Extension/MCP path gating is default-on (no registration needed); per-tool path maps for extension tools (a custom extractor key that supplies the path via a registered `ToolAccessExtractor`) are a deferred follow-up.

The live-authority layer is a Chain of Responsibility (ADR 0007, `docs/decisions/0007-model-judge-authorizer-chain-adr.md`): `composeAuthorizerChain(links, terminal, query)` (`src/authority/authorizer-chain.ts`) runs registered non-terminal `Authorizer` links (`allow | deny | defer`) ahead of the context-selected `TerminalAuthorizer` (which cannot defer).
The `AuthorizerRegistry` (`src/authority/authorizer-registry.ts`) mirrors `ToolAccessExtractorRegistry`: one instance in `index.ts`, its lookup threaded into `AuthorizerSelection` and its registrar exposed cross-extension via `PermissionsService.registerAuthorizer(name, authorize)`.
`AuthorizerSelection.escalate` resolves the `authorizerChain` config **per ask** (not at `activate`) so a link registered in a late `permissions:ready` handler is honored before the session's first ask (ADR 0007 §4); resolution is config-order, skips an unregistered name with a logged `authorizer_chain_unregistered_link` review event (fail-safe), and wraps each link in the bounded-delegation envelope (`src/authority/delegation-envelope.ts`) so an `allow` on an excluded surface (`external_directory` / `path`) is capped to `defer`.
The envelope excludes on the **gate** surface (`details.accessIntent.surface`), falling back to the display surface only when no facts are present, so a forwarded ask must carry the child-fixed facts or it is judged on the child's tool name and escapes the exclusion — `buildForwardedAskDetails` (`src/authority/forwarded-request-server.ts`) therefore projects `surface`/`matchValues`/`boundaryValue` off the request, and only those three: `requesterCwd`/`principal` stay off the ask details (Refs #635).
Each link is handed a narrow, session-scoped `PermissionQuery` (`Pick`-style projection of `PermissionsService`: `checkPermission` / `getToolPermission`) so it queries the engine at gate parity rather than reaching for the service via `Symbol.for()`.
The secret-shaped-`path` refinement of the checkpoint and the allow-capable opaque-bash adjudicator that consumes the query are deferred to #620.

## Testing

Shared test fixtures live in `test/helpers/`:

- `session-fixtures.ts` — real-instance builders for `PermissionSession` / `PermissionResolver` tests: `makeRealSession` (builds a real `PermissionSession` from per-collaborator fakes; returns `{ session, paths, logger, forwarding, permissionManager, sessionRules, configStore, gateway }`), `makeFakePermissionManager` (fake `ScopedPermissionManager` with `vi.fn()` stubs — unannotated return type for full mock access; exposes a single `check(intent, sessionRules?)` stub, the one resolution entry point since #478), `makeRealResolver` (real `PermissionResolver` over a fake manager + `SessionRules`; pass shared instances to connect it to a session's manager/rules), plus `makePaths` / `makeLogger` / `makeConfigStore` / `makeGateway` / `makeForwarding`.
  Tests exercising `resolveAgentName` must mock `active-agent` in their own file (the `vi.hoisted` / `vi.mock` pattern), since that mock is module-scoped.
- `handler-fixtures.ts` — `makeCtx`, `makeEvents`, `makeToolRegistry`, `makeToolCallEvent`, `makeCheckResult` (neutral default, override-driven), `makeHandler` (builds a **real** `PermissionSession` + `PermissionResolver` wired into the handler and pipelines exactly as `index.ts`; the `session` override bag maps `checkPermission` onto `permissionManager.checkPermission` and `getActiveSkillEntries` / `getInfrastructureReadDirs` / `getToolPreviewLimits` / `resolveAgentName` onto `vi.spyOn` overrides of the real session; accepts optional `tools: string[]` and `prompter: AskEscalator` (the single-method ask-escalation seam that replaced `GatePrompter` in #556 — stub it as `{ escalate }`); returns `{ handler, events, session, logger, toolRegistry, prompter, recorder, permissionManager, forwarding }` — `session.activate` is the real method, so assert `forwarding.start` instead), `makeSurfaceCheck` / `makeBashCommandCheck` (surface-/bash-dispatching `checkPermission` mocks — pass the result as `session.checkPermission`, applied to `permissionManager.checkPermission`), `getDecisionEvents`.
  `MockGateHandlerSession` now covers only the pipeline-input surface (`ToolCallGateInputs & SkillInputGateInputs`); the wide 17-field intersection mock and the standalone `makeSession` factory are gone (#341).
- `gate-fixtures.ts` — `makeDescriptor`, `makeGateRunner` (constructs a `GateRunner` with four role mocks and returns `{ runner, deps }` so tests can invoke `runner.run(...)` and assert on `deps.reporter.*`, `deps.resolve`, etc.; accepts optional `resolveResult: PermissionCheckResult` shortcut — wraps `resolve` in a `vi.fn` returning that value, taking precedence over the default allow result), `makeDenialDescriptor` (write-surface variant of `makeDescriptor` with a caller-supplied `DenialContext` — use when testing denial-message formatting), `makeReporter` (`DecisionReporter` mock with `writeReviewLog`/`emitDecision` vi.fn stubs), `makeResolver` (`ScopedPermissionResolver` mock — plain object with a single `vi.fn` `resolve` stub; pass a `PermissionCheckResult` to set its default return value; omitting the arg leaves it returning `undefined` so callers must call `mockReturnValue` or pass a result explicitly, #478), `makePathDispatchResolver` (resolver whose single `resolve` dispatches on the `AccessIntent` kind — `tool` keys on `intent.input.path`, `access-path` on any matching entry in `intent.path.matchValues()` — pass a `byPath` map and a `defaultResult`; since #486 the emitted union is `tool | access-path` only, #393, #478, #486), `makeTcc` (bash defaults: `toolName: "bash"`, `input: { command: "cat .env" }` — passing `{ input: { command: "cat .env" } }` explicitly is redundant and can be omitted), `makeGateCheckResult` (path-surface defaults: `toolName: "path"`, `source: "special"`, `origin: "global"`), `makeGateInputs` (mock of `ToolCallGateInputs` for `ToolCallGatePipeline` unit tests — stubs the three query methods `getActiveSkillEntries`, `getInfrastructureReadDirs`, `getToolPreviewLimits`; the resolver is now a separate `makeResolver(makeCheckResult())` passed as the first arg to `ToolCallGatePipeline` — `makeGateInputs` no longer stubs `resolve`), `makeSkillInputInputs` (mock of `SkillInputGateInputs` for `SkillInputGatePipeline` unit tests — single-method stub for `checkPermission`; returns `makeCheckResult()` by default), `makeNotifier` (`GateNotifier` mock — unannotated return type so callers retain full `vi.fn()` access on `warn`).
  `makeRunnerDeps` has been deleted; `GateRunnerDeps` no longer exists.
- `manager-harness.ts` — `createManager` (filesystem-backed `PermissionManager`), `createManagerWithProject` (two-level harness with global + project config dirs and per-level agent files; returns `{ manager, cleanup }` — use when testing project-level or project-agent precedence), `createManagerWithConfig` (permission-map shorthand delegating to `createManager`), `createManagerWithScopes` (global + optional project permission maps delegating to `createManagerWithProject`), `createMissingConfigManager` (manager over nonexistent paths; universal `ask` default), `createInMemoryPolicyLoader` + `createInMemoryManager` (in-memory `PolicyLoader`, no filesystem — pass the loader directly when overriding `platform`), `createAgentDirHarness` (agentDir-layout harness via `getGlobalConfigPath` / `getProjectConfigPath`), and `sessionRule(surface, pattern, action?)` (session-layer `Rule` builder, default action `allow`).
  These were extracted from `permission-manager-unified.test.ts` in #525 (Phase 8 Step 1); import them instead of redefining local manager factories.
- `make-fake-pi.ts` — `makeFakePi` (composition-root harness): runs the real `piPermissionSystemExtension(pi)` factory against a fake `ExtensionAPI` with a real `createEventBus()`, an inspectable `handlers` map, captured `commands`, and a `fire(event, input, ctx)` driver.
  Use it for composition-root wiring tests (handler-registration completeness, shared-instance contracts, teardown, event ordering) — see `test/composition-root.test.ts`.
  Composition-root tests must `vi.stubEnv("PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR", <tmpdir>)` and clear both `Symbol.for()` global slots (`:service`, `:subagent-registry`) in `afterEach`, since the factory mutates process-global state.

Import from these instead of redefining factories inline.
When a call site needs different defaults from `makeCheckResult`, pass explicit overrides (e.g. `makeCheckResult({ state: "deny", matchedPattern: "*" })`).

Since #478 the manager and resolver each expose a single resolution method (`ScopedPermissionManager.check(intent)` / `ScopedPermissionResolver.resolve(intent)`), so the #393 false-green class is structurally impossible — there is no second method a fixture can stub-but-forget.
`makeHandler` routes the `makeSurfaceCheck` / `makeBashCommandCheck` override onto `permissionManager.check` via an intent→(surface, input) adapter: a `path-values` intent maps to `surfaceCheck(intent.surface, { path: intent.values[0] }, …)` so `path` / `external_directory` overrides apply to bash tokens and tool paths alike (#418).
An inline handler that mocks `permissionManager.check` directly must dispatch on `intent.kind` (`path-values` carries `values`, `tool` carries `input`) and `intent.surface`, or external-directory checks false-green to `allow`.
The gate emitting the intent picks the surface: since #486 every path gate emits `access-path` — the tool/bash path gates on `"path"` and the external-directory gates on `"external_directory"` — and since #502 the per-tool gate also emits `access-path` on the tool-name surface (`read`/`write`/`edit`/`grep`/`find`/`ls`); the resolver unwraps it via `AccessPath.matchValues()` to match a path's typed and symlink-resolved aliases, so the `path` surface and the per-tool surfaces now match the canonical form too (#418, #486, #502).
The gate-emitted `path-values` variant was removed; `path-values` survives only as the resolver-internal `ResolvedAccessIntent` form the string-based manager consumes (so `permissionManager.check` and the `makeHandler` adapter at line above still see `tool | path-values`).
This resolver-internal boundary is a deliberate, formalized seam, not transitional scaffolding (see `docs/decisions/0002-path-values-string-boundary.md`, #506): the manager stays string-based and must not import `AccessPath` — a `no-restricted-imports` lint rule on `permission-manager.ts` guards it.

- Test permission resolution (allow/deny/ask decisions across tools, bash, MCP, skills, special).
- Test wildcard matching (bash patterns, skill globs) including over-match and under-match cases.
- Test policy merge precedence: global → project → per-agent frontmatter.
- Test system-prompt sanitization (denied tool lines narrowed out of the `Available tools:` listing, allowed tools preserved).
- Test the external-directory guard for path-bearing file tools, including extension and MCP tools (default-on path gating, #352).
- Test config loading, validation issues, and tolerance of deprecated keys.
- When a change reads a **new** `ExtensionContext` field/method (e.g. `ctx.isProjectTrusted()`), update `makeCtx` **and** grep every hand-built ctx literal — `grep -rln "hasUI:" test/` (18 files cast `as unknown as ExtensionContext` / `as never`).
  These casts bypass `tsc`, so a missing field fails only at the full-suite run, not `check` or the cycle-scoped file (#644: `permission-events.test.ts` surfaced `ctx.isProjectTrusted is not a function` at runtime).
- To test the file-based permission-forwarding round-trip (a subagent's `ask` reaching the parent), do not `await` the child's `pi.fire("tool_call", …)` directly — `ParentAuthorizer.authorize` (`src/authority/approval-escalator.ts`) polls for a response with a 10-minute timeout when forwarding to the parent.
  Instead: fire without awaiting, poll the parent's `requests/` dir (`createPermissionForwardingLocation(forwardingDir, parentSessionId)`) for the child's request file, write an approval JSON to `responses/<id>.json`, then await the fire.
  See the `subagent registry sharing` test in `test/composition-root.test.ts`.

## Debugging

When investigating a reported bug:

1. Check the runtime environment: which extensions are loaded, from which paths, and whether any are loaded more than once.
2. Check `.pi/settings.json` and `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` for overlapping package entries.
3. Instrument only after confirming the bug reproduces in isolation.
4. When the bug involves path, filesystem, or platform semantics, check how `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` solves it first (local checkout or published source).
   Prefer Node `path` builtins (`path.relative`, `path.win32`/`path.posix`) over hand-rolled comparison; pi's containment idiom is `relative()` + a `..`/absolute-prefix check (case-insensitive on Windows).
   The win32-vs-POSIX decision has a single home: `pathFlavorForPlatform` (`src/path/path-flavor.ts`), which resolves the host `platform` into a `PathFlavor` — the platform's path *language* (syntax `hasPathSeparator`, semantics `bashTokenShape`, equivalence `fold`/`comparable`/`isWithin`/`matchOptions`, plus Node's `impl`) — as one of two cached singletons (`win32PathFlavor` / `posixPathFlavor`) holding the package's only `=== "win32"` comparison (#562).
   `index.ts` performs the one `process.platform` read and injects the resolved flavor into `PermissionManager`, `PermissionSession` (→ `PathNormalizer`, built at the session edge with the flavor + session `cwd`, exposed via `PermissionSession.getPathNormalizer()`, #510), and `SubagentDetection`; the `getPlatform()` accessor was retired once both #511 and #502 folded their reads (#513).
   Hand the normalizer raw tokens (`forPath`/`forLiteral`/`isAbsolute`/`resolveBase`/`joinBase`/`isWithinDirectory`/`isOutsideWorkingDirectory`/`comparableValue`/`isInfrastructureRead`); do **not** read `process.platform` inside `src/` — an ESLint `no-restricted-syntax` guard scoped to `pi-permission-system/src` (exempting `index.ts`, the only reader) blocks it, and every path leaf (`path/path-containment` / `access-intent/path-normalization` / `path/pi-infrastructure-read` / `path/canonicalize-path` / `rule.ts` / `authority/subagent-context`) takes an injected `PathFlavor`, never a raw `platform` (the `path-utils.ts` grab-bag was dissolved into those focused modules in #505; the three co-rewritten path leaves relocated into `src/path/` in #562).
   To test Windows behavior on a POSIX CI, construct a `win32` `PathNormalizer` with `win32PathFlavor` (or pass `flavor: win32PathFlavor` to `makeRealSession` / the manager) — never `vi.mock("node:path")`.
5. When a report claims a path/permission **bypass** (or that a rule is evadable), reproduce the literal repro against the running extension before concluding it is already handled — a live deny is stronger evidence than unit tests and can surface adjacent bugs (#493's bypass claim was already fixed, but the live repro exposed a misleading prompt, filed as #507).

The gate fails closed (#452).
Every `tool_call` goes through `createFailClosedToolCall` (`src/handlers/tool-call-boundary.ts`), the only `pi.on("tool_call")` target and the sole place an internal `GateOutcome` is translated to the SDK result shape.
A thrown gate is blocked (not allowed) and recorded as a `permission_request.blocked` review entry with `resolution: "gate_error"` — the SDK's `emitToolCall` does not catch a throwing handler, so this boundary must absorb it.
An unparseable bash command (a non-empty command that parses to zero command units) resolves to `ask` with the `<unparseable-bash-command>` sentinel `matchedPattern`, instead of falling through to a permissive top-level `*`.
A wrapper unit is flagged by the command enumerator with a `wrapperKind` discriminant (`classifyWrapperCommand`) and floored from `allow` to `ask` via the `WRAPPER_SENTINEL` map: `"opaque-payload"` (`bash`/`sh`/`dash`/`zsh`/`ksh -c`, or `eval`) → `<opaque-bash-wrapper>` (#481); `"indirection"` (`INDIRECTION_WRAPPER_NAMES` = `sudo`/`env`/`xargs`/`time`/`nohup`/`timeout`/`nice`/`parallel`/`rust-parallel`/`rush`/`doas`/`setsid`/`stdbuf`/`watch`/`flock`, plus `find`/`fd` carrying a per-result exec flag via `EXEC_CONDITIONAL_WRAPPERS`) → `<indirection-bash-wrapper>` (#490, extended #575) — so `bash -c "…"` and `sudo aws …` prompt even under a permissive `allow` (an explicit `deny` still wins; a bare `find`/`fd` search is unaffected).
The enumerator also strips a leading `variable_assignment` prefix from each command unit so an env-var prefix (`AWS_PROFILE=prod aws …`) cannot defeat a command-pattern rule (#481).
With `debugLog` on, the boundary writes one `permission.decision` trace per call and a `permission.session_summary` line on shutdown (via `DecisionAudit`); a `toolCalls != allowed + blocked + errors` mismatch logs a warning — a re-opened silent path.

The bash enforcement stack is not limited to the native `bash` tool: the `shellTools` config maps a foreign tool name to `{ commandArgument, workdirArgument? }`, and `resolveShellInvocation` (`src/access-intent/tool-kind.ts`) is the single dispatch point that turns native `bash` *or* an aliased tool (e.g. `@howaboua/pi-codex-conversion`'s `exec_command`) into a `{ command, workdir }` shell invocation — every other tool yields `null` (#574).
The gate pipeline consults it once, parses the command into a shared `BashProgram` (which owns its source command via `commandText()`, so the two bash gates read it rather than re-deriving `input.command`), and routes the aliased command through the same `resolveBashCommandCheck` + bash path/external-directory gates as native bash — so fail-closed, wrapper flooring, and `bash:` rules apply identically.
The aliased tool is gated on the `bash` surface (a session "allow" writes a `bash:` rule) while the invoked tool name is preserved in the review log.
A `workdirArgument` seeds the path-walk's initial base (an implicit leading `cd <workdir>`) so relative tokens resolve against it, and the workdir itself is flagged `external_directory` when outside the session cwd; containment always measures against the session cwd, never the workdir, so an aliased tool cannot widen the sandbox.
`classifyToolKind` stays config-free — the alias consult is a separate function because it needs config and returns a richer product.

## Windows and Git Bash

Platform facts verified against Pi core source during #533 planning:

- **Pi core executes every bash tool command through Git Bash on Windows** (`pi/packages/coding-agent/src/utils/shell.ts`): resolution order is custom `shellPath` → `%ProgramFiles%\Git\bin\bash.exe` → any `bash.exe` on PATH (MSYS2/Cygwin); there is no cmd/PowerShell branch.
  So bash tokens gated on a `win32` host carry POSIX/MSYS path semantics, while tool-input paths (`read`/`write`/`edit`) carry Node `fs` win32 semantics — the two surfaces have **different platforms** on the same host.
- Node `fs` on Windows genuinely resolves `/dev/null` to `C:\dev\null`, so a *tool-input* `/dev/null` prompting is correct behavior; a *bash* `> /dev/null` prompting is a bug — Git Bash's MSYS runtime maps it to the NUL device and never touches the filesystem.
- Pi core rewrites Windows-style `> NUL` redirects to `> /dev/null` before spawning the shell (`normalizeNulRedirects()`, [earendil-works/pi#4731]), because MSYS does not recognize `NUL` and would create a literal undeletable file.
  So `/dev/null` is the canonical device token the gates see on win32 — core actively produces it.
- MSYS interprets POSIX-shaped absolute paths through its mount table: `/dev/*` are runtime devices; `/c/…` is a deterministic drive mount for `C:\…`; `/tmp` is a mount whose Windows target **varies by bash flavor** (Git Bash → `%TEMP%`; MSYS2 → `<msysroot>\tmp`; Cygwin → its own root) and other absolutes (`/usr`, `/etc`, `/mingw64`) resolve inside the install root.
  This package therefore must never map `/tmp` (or any non-drive-mount POSIX absolute) to a concrete Windows path — no `cygpath` shell-outs, no `os.tmpdir()` reads; determinism (same policy + same input → same decision) forbids both.
- Git Bash also accepts Windows-shaped paths (`C:/foo`, `C:\foo`) unchanged, so the drive-letter token handling (#508) and win32 case folding (#382) apply to those shapes on both surfaces — the MSYS semantics above are *additive* branches for POSIX-shaped tokens, not a replacement.
- On win32 a backslash is a path separator, so a backslash-relative bash argument (`cat dir\file`) is gated by the `path` surface the same as `dir/file` ([#520]); the broad rule-candidate classifier recognizes it via `PathFlavor.hasPathSeparator` (the win32 flavor counts `\` as a separator), and it resolves through the ordinary win32 `forBashToken` (`plain`) branch.
  On POSIX `\` is a legal filename character, so the token stays bare there.
- The bash-token interpretation layer implementing these semantics (exact `/dev/*` devices preserved, `/c/` mounts translated, other POSIX absolutes literal-only external) shipped in #533: `PathNormalizer.forBashToken`/`interpretBashCdTarget`/`isBoundaryOutsideWorkingDirectory` branch on the shape returned by the pure `access-intent/bash/msys-bash-tokens.ts` classifier, and `BashPathResolver` routes every bash token (both the `external_directory` and `path` surfaces) through `forBashToken`.
  See `docs/decisions/0003-git-bash-posix-path-semantics.md`.
- A win32 non-mount POSIX absolute (`/tmp/foo`) is a literal-only `AccessPath` matched and displayed exactly as typed, and a `/tmp/*` allow rule suppresses its prompt.
  This works because the win32 path fold (`pathMatchOptions` in `rule.ts` → `PathFlavor.matchOptions`) normalizes separators on **both** the rule pattern and the matched value.
  Folding only the pattern — the pre-#653 behavior — made every forward-slash match value unmatchable, silently voiding a rule like `path: {"/dev/null": "allow"}` on Windows.
  Keep the fold symmetric: matching goes through `CompiledWildcardPattern.matches(value)`, which owns both halves, and the compiled pattern exposes no raw `RegExp` a caller could `.test()` with an unfolded value.
  A win32 path shape therefore needs no hand-built backslash match alias (#533's was removed in #653).

## Notes for Agents

Before implementing, understand:

1. The problem being solved.
2. Which permission surface is involved (tools / bash / mcp / skills / special / external_directory).
3. The merge precedence between global, project, and per-agent policies.
4. Whether the change renames the `/permission-system` slash command — if yes, it is breaking.
5. The need to keep schema, example config, loader, and docs aligned.

Do not assume "allow" is a safe default.
Do not add a permission surface without also adding a policy field, schema entry, and example.

When writing documentation that claims this extension lacks a feature, verify by searching `src/`, `docs/retro/`, and closed issues.

When planning a refactoring that targets testability, read the test files alongside the production code.

When planning a refactoring that touches handler wiring or shared interfaces, load the `design-review` skill to audit for structural smells before writing the plan.

The bash `external_directory` gate only sees tokens that `classifyTokenAsPathCandidate` accepts — absolute (`/…`), home-relative (`~/…`), parent-traversal (`..`), and Windows drive-letter absolute paths (`C:/…` or `C:\…`).
A plain `./relative` token (e.g. `cat ./link/hosts`) is dropped before that gate and is instead gated by the broader `path` surface (`classifyTokenAsRuleCandidate`).
The broader classifier also recognizes the backslash drive form (`D:\…`) — the forward-slash form is caught by `includes("/")`.
On win32 the broad classifier additionally recognizes a backslash-relative token (`dir\file`, no leading `.`, no `/`, no `..`, not a drive-letter absolute) as a `path`-surface candidate — gated the same as its forward-slash equivalent `dir/file` ([#520]) — while on POSIX `\` is a legal filename character so the token stays bare; the decision is `PathFlavor.hasPathSeparator`, which the win32 flavor answers by counting `\`, so the classifier never reads `process.platform`.
On POSIX, a drive-shaped token (`C:/foo`) resolves as the real in-CWD path `./C:/foo` and remains gated by the `path` surface; the `PathNormalizer`'s `isAbsolute` decides platform-correct routing.
Once a token passes classification, its resolution is platform-aware on win32: `PathNormalizer.forBashToken` applies Git Bash/MSYS semantics (safe `/dev/*` devices preserved, `/c/…` drive mounts translated to `C:\…`, other POSIX absolutes kept literal-only) before building the `AccessPath`, so a plan must not assume a leading-`/` win32 bash token resolves with `node:path.win32` rules (#533; see the Windows and Git Bash section).
A bare filename (`cat id_rsa`, `cat outside-link`), which has none of the broad classifier's accepted shapes, is promoted into **both** path projections when it names an existing filesystem entry — the existence probe (`BashPathResolver.probeBareToken` → `PathNormalizer.entryExists`, lstat) that replaced [#509]'s rule-driven promotion in [#645].
Candidacy comes from the filesystem and the decision from explicit rules or the cwd boundary, so no classifier consults the ruleset; `docs/decisions/0009-bash-path-projection-completeness-contract.md` is the governing record.
Because a promoted token flows through the ordinary `AccessPath` canonicalization, a symlink is matched by rules naming its **target** — the case raw-token matching could never see — and one resolving outside the tree reaches `external_directory` exactly like `cat /tmp/x`.
A bare token naming nothing is dropped (`git status` never prompts, even under `path: {"*": "deny"}`), and a promoted token matching no explicit rule stays unrestricted via the `matchedPattern === undefined` guard, so promotion cannot turn the universal fallback into a prompt firehose.
The probe requires a **known** effective base, so a bare token after a non-literal `cd` stays unpromoted ([#393] conservatism).
An `--opt=value` token additionally has its value emitted as its own token at collection (`collectEmbeddedOptionValues`), so `grep --file=/tmp/patterns` gates the embedded path while `--format=json` yields a bare `json` that names nothing ([#645]).
When a plan or test asserts a specific bash repro string, trace the token through the classifier first — an issue's headline repro can describe a symptom whose literal input never reaches the gate being changed.
